# Essays I like
Note (2025): I made this a year ago, and then neglected to update it.
Slowly in the process of fixing that...

In no particular order, incomplete, inconsistently categorized. Mostly for my own reference, when I forget where an idea comes from. 

I'm always eager for any recommendations.
