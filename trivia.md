# Trivia
Some useless facts about me that don't belong anywhere else. 
- I can type consistently around 110 WPM (via [typingtest.com](https://www.typingtest.com)), but have typed above 160 WPM on tests like [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) (where there are only common English words randomly ordered.) Of course, my actual writing speed is much slower, on the order of ten words per minute.
- Every time I have gone to Europe, I've lost my right AirPod. (2x so far...)
- I listen to too much electronic music.

Some games I definitely don't regret playing:
- Celeste
- Rainworld
- Doki Doki Literature Club

Some games I (frequently) regret playing:
- osu!
- TETR.IO
- Factorio
