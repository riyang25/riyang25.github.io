# About
Here's some of my current interests.
- Physics. I'm intending to major in physics in college. In 2024, I won a gold medal at the European Physics Olympiad. 
- Math. Some topics I want to learn include abstract algebra, number theory and cryptography, complex analysis, partial differential equations, and nonlinear dynamics.
- Computer Science. I'm interested in the fundamentals of how computers operate, as well as how to do useful things with them. 

Some things I do:
- I'm the current organizer of the [Iowa City Math Circle](https://iowacitymathcircle.org).
- I helped run the 2024 [Online Physics Olympiad](https://opho.physoly.tech). If you're interested in physics competitions, consider participating!
