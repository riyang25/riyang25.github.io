# About
My name is Richard Yang. I'm a high school senior. 

Here's some of my current interests.
- Physics. For the past two years or so, I've studied for the [USA Physics Olympiad](https://aapt.org/physicsteam). In 2024, I qualified for the US Physics Team, and was selected to compete at the 2024 European Physics Olympiad. 
- Math. My main focus used to be the [AMC Competition Series](https://maa.org), but nowadays I'm spending more time on higher math.  
- Computer Science. 

Some things I do:
- I'm the current organizer of the [Iowa City Math Circle](https://iowacitymathcircle.org).
- I helped run the 2024 [Online Physics Olympiad](https://opho.physoly.tech). If you're interested in physics competitions, consider participating! 

Here's my [resume](./resume/index.md).

## Trivia
Some useless facts about me that don't belong anywhere else. 
- I can type consistently around 110 WPM (via [typingtest.com](https://www.typingtest.com)), but have typed above 160 WPM on tests like [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) (where there are only common English words randomly ordered.) Of course, my actual writing speed is much slower, on the order of ten words per minute.
- Some of my favorite textbooks:
  - Concepts in Thermal Physics, Blundell & Blundell
  - Physics, Halliday Resnick Krane
