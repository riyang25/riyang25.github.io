## How did I take so many university courses in high school?
I'm very thankful for my school district's Post-Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) program. Students who have exhausted the high school curriculum in a subject can enroll to take undergraduate level courses at the University of Iowa, and it's completely free. Other school districts have similar programs.

A word of caution: If you have to pay more than a few hundred dollars to take a university class, I would advise against it. This applies especially to paid online courses! The internet has made self studying, for free, more accessible than ever.
