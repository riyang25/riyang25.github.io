### GRIS
### Rain World
## Puzzle Games
### Baba Is You

## Rhythm Games
## RPGs
### Paper Lily
A lovely little puzzle/horror RPG, with tremendous amounts of SOVL. First chapter is a very tantalizing look into a fascinating world. Eagerly awaiting the second chapter.
## Visual Novels
### DDLC
A classic for a reason. My first playthrough of this was done solely after midnight which may have not been the greatest idea.
### The NOexistenceN of you And me
A very surreal game. Feels like there's something enormous contained in it that I've barely wrapped my head around. Anime girl(s) explaining existentialism to you. What's not to like?
### of the Devil
todo
### 饿殍：明末千里行
It's a very good VN, and it's Chinese. Content warning: it can get quite dark, and cannibalism is a big theme. Gives you a real sense of the ruin suffered so often in Chinese history as dynasties topple. There are three "fake" endings you can encounter; you have to achieve at least two in order to get the two possible true endings. Eagerly waiting for the sequel.
