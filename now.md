# Now
What I've been up to recently.

Last updated: Aug 6 2025

## Plans
I plan to attend MIT this fall. The amount of things I want to learn and the amount of time I have for doing so is something like a PhD's worth of knowledge in two years. I suspect this may not be realistic.

The alternative to going to college is probably a startup. Unfortunately my current talents are not very directly useful for the typical startup. I'm trying to figure out a program of actions to fix this.

I think AI is likely going to be the most important technology of our time; I'd like to figure out how to deal with this.

Recently I've been learning Mandarin. My consistency hasn't been stellar since coming back home from China, but I think this is probably something that's pretty important to do.
