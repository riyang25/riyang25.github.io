# Now
What I've been up to recently.

Last updated: Jan 12th 2026

## Plans
I'm currently attending MIT. The amount of things I want to learn and the amount of time I have for doing so is something like a PhD's worth of knowledge in two years. I suspect this may not be realistic.

I think AI is likely going to be the most important technology of our time. It seems like society is dropping the ball in a lot of ways, and I'd like to help fix that.

I've been learning Mandarin since July last year. I think this is probably something that's pretty important to do for the future. Currently I can recognize ~900 characters!
