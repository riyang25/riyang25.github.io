# Now
What I've been up to recently.

Last updated: Sept 1st 2025

## Plans
I'm attending MIT this fall. The amount of things I want to learn and the amount of time I have for doing so is something like a PhD's worth of knowledge in two years. I suspect this may not be realistic.

The alternative to going to college is probably a startup. Unfortunately my current talents are not very directly useful for the typical startup. I'd like to figure out how to fix this.

I think AI is likely going to be the most important technology of our time. I'm trying to find out what role I'd like to have with it in the coming years.

Recently I've been learning Mandarin. My consistency hasn't been stellar since coming back home from China, but I think this is probably something that's pretty important to do.
