# Now
What I've been up to recently.

## Plans
I'm currently attending MIT. The amount of things I want to learn and the amount of time I have for doing so is something like a PhD's worth of knowledge in two years. I suspect this may not be realistic.

I think AI is likely going to be the most important technology of our time. It seems to me that we are dropping the ball in a lot ways, and I'd like to be able to help fix that.

I've been learning Mandarin ever since coming back home from my trip to China in the summer. I think this is probably something that's pretty important to do for the future. Currently I can recognize ~600 characters!
